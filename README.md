Excellent Scala
===============

First things first
------------------

I've recently decided I really only _want_ to write code in Scala.

Sometimes I _have_ to write code in Java, or JavaScript, or bash, or
some other such nonsense...

But I _like_ coding in Scala so much more than any other language I've
worked with. So I've created a space in which to explore, and to become
an expert.

A note on building stuff
------------------------

As much as I like Scala... I *really* don't like SBT. Maybe I haven't
given it enough of a chance, and I'll probably end up coming around on
it eventually (after all, I pretty much hated Scala when I first saw
it). But for now, I like Maven. I don't think Maven is the *best* thing
possible, but its more than adequate, and (for me at least) it kind of
stays out of the way.
